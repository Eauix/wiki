Introduction
------------

The story of SuperTux focuses on Tux the penguin who has to save his beloved girlfriend Penny
from the clutches of the evil Nolok.

Icy Island
----------

### Intro: Penny gets captured!

(Plays at the start of the game - see also [Milestone 1 version](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/v0.1.4/data/intro.txt))

*" Somewhere at the shores of Antarctica... "*

Tux and Penny are shown having a picnic at the antarctic shore. In the background, there's an ice bush, which
eventually starts shaking a bit, attracting the focus of the camera. Suddenly, Nolok jumped from behind the nearby
ice bush and summoned a bright flash with his mighty staff. The flash blinded Tux and Penny was captured in the
process. Nolok had only left a small note behind.

The note reads: “Tux, my arch enemy! I have kidnapped your beloved Penny and have taken her to my fortress. The
path to my fortress is littered with my minions. Give up on the thought of trying to reclaim her, you don't have
a chance of saving her! Signed, Nolok”

As Tux looked up and Nolok's castle appears foggily in the distance.. Realizing the trouble Penny could be in,
Tux became determined to save her. He begins his journey.

### Interlude: Exit of the cave

(Plays after finishing the level “The End of the Tunnel”)

Tux walks out of the ice cave but stops as he hears a strange sound in the distance. A yeti appeared to be
watching him from higher up on a small incline. Before Tux could do anything, however, the yeti ran away.
Tux was concerned by the yeti's sudden retreat but decided to continue his journey as he had spotted a castle,
in the same direction the yeti went.

### Interlude: Empty Throne Room

(Plays at the end of the level "Castle Of Nolok")

Tux reaches an empty throne room with a letter hanging on a pillar. There is a door near by. Tux hears the yeti
an runs towards it. He opens the door and finds himself at a balcony outside the castle walls. He jumps down into
the yeti battle area.

Tux entered the castle's throne room, frantically searching for his beloved. Alas, he found nothing but an empty
room. No Nolok, no Penny. Only another note on a piller but this time from Penny.

Nolok had tricked him and took off with Penny to a far forest. Tux began to worry even more now. He had no idea
where the forest was or how to get there. His worries were cut short however, as out of a sudden  he heared a loud
roar. The yeti had returned running right towards him shouting aggressively! There was a door near by.

Tux immediately ran towards a nearby door and found himself at a balcony outside the castle walls and jumped. The
yeti followed him down to a small ravine, leaving Tux no other choice than to fight the yeti. The battle starts.

### Outro

(Played after beating the Yeti)

At last, the yeti was beaten. Rubbing his head and angrily grunting the yeti communicated his disbelief.
When asked by Tux if he knew where Nolok went and how he could get there the yeti just laughed at the penguin.
Though, while further tantalizing Tux about his cluelessness the yeti accidentally revealed the location of the
forest and where to find a boat. Realizing this, the yeti sets off before revealing even more infomation leaving
Tux behind. Tux now knew where he must go and sets off towards the glacier isle to find the crystal mine.

Rooted Forest
-------------

### Intro

(Plays immediately after setting foot on world 2)

A long trip to the north with a boat and Tux finally managed to reach the southern lands of Rooted Forest. Upon
setting shore, Tux hops out of his boat and takes his first steps in the grass. Tux has a small inner monolog while
wandering around, looking where to go. He decides to find some place higher up to get a better view of the land,
since he had no idea where Nolok could have stationed his forest castle.

### Interlude: The Land Is Changing

(Plays right before the corrupted forest)

Astonished by the scale of the forest and the much warmer temperatures Tux continued his search for Nolok and
Penny. After a long journey through the woods, rough weather and a dark underground tunnel section (a mossy and rocky
cavern), Tux went ahead and climbed onto a high plateau to get a better view. Something very strange started happening.
The trees and bushes, the entire forest terrin that Tux was in began slowly changing. Everything began to rot away,
turning bluish purple, covered in thick dark green vines. Dark purple roots break through the ground, the sky get dark
and cloudy. Eerie wisps and living flames emerged. Nolok's minions he encountered before were affected as well looking
much more menacing and eerie, but also... worried. Some were even covered in purple roots. Tux felt uneasy but pushed
forward. The scene then cuts to Nolok who says that Tux has done well to get so far through the forest, but will not
get past the dangers in the corrupted forest. Tux spots a tower in the distance and heads off towards it.

### Tower

Tux discovered a tower close by. He entered the tower, but yet again no Nolok nor Penny in sight.
Now Tux was completely at a loss. Suddenly, the walls and roof began crumbling, gigantic purple roots emerged
from all places and flailing around aggressively tearing the tower appart. Tux ran out of the tower as fast as
he could, only to find the root of these troubles. An enormous, terrifying tree with deep dark holes as eyes,
gazed down upon the small penguin and began attacking with all its might.

After a rough battle, Tux managed to destroy the Ghost Tree healing the forest and all beings affected by it.
But his journey wasn't over just yet...

### Interlude: Boss (The Gigantic Tree)

(Plays at the end of the castle level of Rooted Forest, before the boss battle of world 2)

Tux reaches the top of the tower but still cannot find Penny or Nolok. The tower then begins to crumble. Dark
purple roots tear down the building and Tux flees. Close by the Ghost Tree boss awaits him. Shows a conversation
between Tux and the forest boss.

### Outro

(Played after beating the ghost tree forest boss)

Tux is shown combating the forest boss. The ghost tree withers away and the forest returns back to normal.


Proposed story for bonus/future worlds
--------------------------------------

The rest of this document is just some brainstorming ideas for future worlds that may or may not exist.

### Corrupted Forest

The Ghost Tree was planted by Nolok using his mighty staff to corrupt the forest and its inhabitants to be
more eerie and dangerous. A group of Granito, inhabitants of the forest who have not yet been overtaken
by the Ghost Tree's disease asked Tux to help save their home and fellow Granito that have been corrupted already.
When the Ghost Tree is destroyed and the Granito are healed some of the once infected Granito living near the tower
inform Tux about noticing someone strange leaving with another of Tux's kind to the north-east, shortly before the
disease began to spread.

### Tropical Paradise

Tux travels with the help of Granito to a tropical island after the forest keep, named Tropical Paradise.

### Totem Puzzle

(Played upon entering the jungle section of world 3 and shows the user of some puzzle involving totems that needs to be completed)

### Boss

A majestic Toucan resides among the totem temples located on the tropical island creating totems in his image. Nolok
met the bird and offered him more land and power if he could successfully impede Tux's progress and defend the hidden
teleporter to his fortress on top of a mountain peak. After defeating the Toucan and his Master Totem, Tux finds Nolok's
base camp by the teleporter. Before Tux could confront him however, Nolok teleports to his mountain fortress. Tux gives
chase and also uses the teleporter...

### Nolok's Mountain Peak

Tux had now finally found Nolok's final fortress on top an enormous mountain. However, the entrance door was locked
requiring five keys for it to be opened. Nolok, from across his walls, taunts Tux telling him that he hid away the
keys all over the world and without these Penny would be lost forever.

### Interlude: Entering Final Fortress

(Played at the entrance level to Nolok's final fortress, if all five NOLOK-keys are collected)

Shows Tux using the five keys to enter the castle.

### Penny's Story Add-on

A scene showing Penny in a prison cell, trying to escape. She is unaware about Tux's current location.

While captured, Penny attempts to flee herself but in the end is stopped by the cunning Nolok. But instead of giving up
she writes down information she overhears from Nolok himself in a letter in hopes to reach Tux and to inform him on
Nolok's plans help him as much as she can on his journey.

### Nolok's Motive

Once Tux reaches the end of Rooted Forest, Nolok starts to notice Tux's determination being impressed by his commitment
and bravery to push through even leaving his homeland. After defeating Nolok and rescuing Penny, Nolok acknowledges Tux
and Penny's bravery shown a more honorable side. He claims to not change his ways due to his nature as a predator, but
that he respects the two as his equals.

*(Note: Should Nolok ever capture her again or perhaps Tux, he would do it for the entertainment of them having to go
through his challenges again.)*
