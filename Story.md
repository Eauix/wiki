Introduction

### Interlude: Exit of the cave

(Played after finishing "End of the tunnel")

Tux noticed a strange sound in the distance. A yeti appeared to be watching him from afar. Before Tux could do anything, however, the yeti ran away. Tux was concerned by the yeti's sudden retreat but decided to continue his journey as he had spotted a castle.

### Interlude: Castle

(Played at the end of the castle level - see also [Milestone 1 version](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/v0.1.4/data/extro.txt))

Tux ran through a door into Nolok's throne room,
frantically searching for his beloved.
Alas, he found an empty throne room. No Nolok, no Penny. Only another note from Nolok.

"Well done, Tux, well done. If you are
reading this, you have removed my
control over this icy fortress. But as
you can see, your beloved Penny is not
here. What you did not realize is that
this is just one of my many fortresses,
spread far across the lands!

"Tux, your ambition is most honorable,
but futile nonetheless. With every
fortress you conquer of mine, I will
escape to another, and take Penny with
me. Do not be silly... it is best that
you give up now."

Nolok had tricked him and took off with Penny to a far forest. Tux began
to worry even more now. He had no idea where the forest was or how to get there.
Tux was sadly leaving the room, when he
felt something beneath his foot... an
envelope, addressed to him! Inside was
a roughly sketched map with fortresses
drawn in various lands. On the corner
of the map was Penny's signature, a
drawing of the ice flower.

Tux ran out of the fortress, map in
hand. No, he decided, he would not give
up. Penny was counting on him.

### Interlude: Boss

(Played before the level “No more Mr Ice Guy”)

An angry roar can be heard in the distance. All of a sudden the yeti Tux had seen before had returned, running right towards him shouting aggressively!
Tux immediately ran towards a ravine (yeti battle area) and jumped. The yeti followed him down to a small incline, leaving Tux no other choice than to fight the yeti. There is a short conversation between Tux and the Yeti. It turns out that the yeti is Nolok's henchman and was waiting outside the castle to trap Tux! The battle starts.

### Outro/Forest Intro

(Played after beating the Yeti)

At last, the yeti was beaten. Rubbing his head and angrily grunting the yeti communicated his disbelief.
When asked by Tux if he knew where Nolok went and how he could get there the yeti just laughed at the penguin.
Though, while further tantalizing Tux about his cluelessness the yeti accidentally revealed the location of the
forest and where to find a boat. Tux runs away from the Yeti before the Yeti recovers from his mistake. As Tux runs from the Yeti monster, he sees a ship. The monster is gaining, and the ship is leaving. Tux only has one chance... he gets on his belly and slides as fast as he can, because he goes faster when he slides. Tux gets massive “Air Time” as he flies off an iceberg cliff, Yeti in pursuit. The Yeti can't stop in time and falls in to the deep ocean. Tux screams “I'm coming, Penny!” as he lands on a ship with his belly. The ship moves a little and the crystal mine comes into view.

Forest
------

A long trip to the north with a boat and Tux finally managed to reach the southern lands of Rooted Forest.
Astonished by the scale of the forest and the much warmer temperatures Tux continued his search for Nolok and
Penny. Since he had no idea where Nolok could have stationed his forest castle he went ahead and climbed onto
a high plateau through a mossy and rocky cavern to get a better view. 

Soon later, Tux discovered a tower close by. He entered the tower, but yet again no Nolok nor Penny in sight.
Now Tux was completely at a loss. Suddenly, the walls and roof began crumbling, gigantic purple roots emerged
from all places and flailing around aggressively tearing the tower appart. Tux ran out of the tower as fast as
he could, only to find the root of these troubles. An enormous, terrifying tree with deep dark holes as eyes,
gazed down upon the small penguin and began attacking with all its might.

After a rough battle, Tux managed to destroy the Ghost Tree healing the forest and all beings affected by it.
But his journey wasn't over just yet...

### Interlude: Rooted Forest

(Played before rooted forest section)

After a long journey through the woods, rough weather and a dark underground section, something very strange
started happening. The trees and bushes, the entire forest that Tux was in began changing. Everything began to
rot away, turning bluish purple, covered in thick dark green vines. Eerie wisps and living flames emerged.
Nolok's minions he encountered before were affected as well looking much more menacing and eerie, but also...
worried. Some were even covered in purple roots. Tux felt uneasy but pushed forward. The scene then cuts to Nolok who says that Tux has done well to get so far through the forest, but will not get past the dangers in the rooted forest(probably should have a name).

### Interlude: Forest Keep

(Played before entering the first forest castle level)

Shows Tux using the five keys to enter the castle.

### Interlude: Forest Boss

(Played before the boss battle of world 2)

Shows a conversation between Tux and the forest boss. Switch to another scene showing Penny in a prison cell, trying to escape. Penny shouts “Tux where are you?”. She is unaware that Tux is nearby. It is possible this is where she then suddenly thinks up or starts to think up her escape plan.

### Forest Outro/Tropical Islands Intro

(Played after beating the forest boss)

Tux is shown combatting the forest boss. Scene is switched to Penny, who finally managed to escape her cell. She flees through a window or a crack in the wall, gets out of the castle and disappears in the background. Switch back to Tux who beat the boss and finds her empty cell. Go back to Penny again and show her leaving the forest and entering the next world. In World 3, the player will take Penny's role, and the story is continued from her point of view. (For world 3 only)

Proposed story for bonus/future worlds
--------------------------------

The rest of this document is just some brainstorming ideas for future worlds that may or may not exist.

### Corrupted Forest

The Ghost Tree was planted by Nolok using his mighty staff to corrupt the forest and its inhabitants to be
more eerie and dangerous. A group of Granito, inhabitants of the forest who have not yet been overtaken
by the Ghost Tree's disease asked Tux to help save their home and fellow Granito that have been corrupted already.
When the Ghost Tree is destroyed and the Granito are healed some of the once infected Granito living near the tower
inform Tux about noticing someone strange leaving with another of Tux's kind to the north-east, shortly before the
disease began to spread.

## Tropical Islands

Tux goes to a tropical island after the forest keep, named Tropical Paradise.

### Tropical Islands Totem Puzzle

(Played after a couple of levels and shows the user of some puzzle involving totems that needs to be completed)

### Tropical Islands Boss

A majestic Toucan resides among the totem temples creating totems in his image. Nolok met the bird and offered him more land and power if he could successfully impede Tux's progress and defend the hidden teleporter to his fortress on top of a mountain peak. So Tux fights. Tux finds Nolok's base camp by the portal. Nolok is chasing Tux, who is chasing Penny. Penny disappears, and Tux evades Nolok. Player control is switched back to Tux. Nolok travels to world 4...

Panda bear: Tux is on a pier on the other side of the island, when he hears a splash. He looks at the water, and sees a giant panda bear get out and on to the pier. Tux prepares to fight him...

The boss panda bear is stunned, and he falls in to the water, causing a huge wave. Tux is swept off his feet and carried through the water, screaming. Four hours later, he finds himself on a beach of an island covered with beautiful sculptures, buildings, and more. As Tux gets up, he sees another penguin wearing a turban on the beach, building a canoe. Tux walks over to him, and asks him what is going on. The penguin looks at him, and in a thick accent says “I am Salsa, ex-ruler of this island. Earlier today, an evil being came to my humble abode and took all my jewels, riches, and power. He called himself Nolok, and drove the people of my Royal kingdom away. He had a girl with him, but I could not see her very well,” and Tux offers to help him. Salsa stands up, and agrees. They begin to head inside the city...

## Ocean

Tux finds the Helicopter that Nolok took Penny in but there is no one there. So, Tux heads off to find Nolok's Hideout, Tux looks around and sees nothing but 16 metal\\concrete platforms. Tux finds out that he must pull a lever on each of these to raise (uncover?) Nolok's Hidden fortress.

## Grassland

After Nolok flees with Penny out of his ocean hideaway, he ends up in a vast Grassland area. It seems to be easier than the previous two worlds as Tux can see the castle in the distance, but when he gets there he finds a number of doors each containing many hazards. He must enter each one to press some (ropes/levers/buttons) to bridge some huge “security” gaps in Nolok's main room. Again, Tux just misses Penny, but finds a new note from her telling him something that will aid him in the next world.

### Nolok's Mountain Peak

Tux had now finally found Nolok's final fortress on top an enormous mountain. However, the entrance door was locked
requiring five keys for it to be opened. Nolok, from across his walls, taunts Tux telling him that he hid away the
keys all over the world and without these Penny would be lost forever.

### Penny's Story Add-on

While captured, Penny attempts to flee herself but in the end is stopped by the cunning Nolok. But instead of giving up
she writes down information she overhears from Nolok himself in a letter in hopes to reach Tux and to inform him on
Nolok's plans help him as much as she can on his journey.

### Nolok's Motive

Nolok as a character derives pleasure from causing harm or crime. So the reason he kidnaps Penny is that he derives
entertainment out of Tux feeling sorrow towards his beloved Penny and having no idea where to find here. Additionally,
enjoys to see Tux suffer on his journey thus setting out his minions, leading him to a false castle or corrupting an
entire forest to frighten him.

Once Tux reaches the end of Rooted Forest, Nolok starts to notice Tux's determination being impressed by his commitment
and bravery to push through even leaving his homeland. After defeating Nolok and rescuing Penny, Nolok acknowledges Tux
and Penny's bravery shown a more honorable side. He claims to not change his ways due to his nature as a predator, but
that he respects the two as his equals.

*(Note: Should Nolok ever capture her again or perhaps Tux, he would do it for the entertainment of them having to go through his challenges again.)*
