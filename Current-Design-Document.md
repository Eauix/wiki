# About this Document

This document is a work in progress, nothing here is considered even remotely final. Also, SuperTux uses version numbers instead of milestones now. There is a list of stuff that needs to be done, and at the bottom is a list of ideas that could be implemented too. Check our [TODO List](TODO.md) to see what things are being currently worked on or have been finished.

# Overview

SuperTux 0.7.0 will bring about a completion to the first two worlds so work can begin on World 3. This means improving/revamping the graphics, sound effects, code, story and levels in many areas and adding some new features/mechanics as well. (swimming, etc.)

# Audio

**Tux, Penny, Nolok**

Add new sounds/cutscene speech. Perhaps use a new VA?

#Important Bugs

  - In laggy zones, sprites with one loop sometimes repeat. (https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/1453)
  - When flipping, sprites reset to the first frame of the animation, which looks strange. (https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/1462)

# Story

  - Improve it, make it better. There used to be more here but I deleted it because nothing is final yet.


# Levels

**Levels in general**

The levels of the Add-On menu (Bonus Islands I-IV, Halloween 2014, etc.) should be divided from other contrib levels, which can be downloaded manually or in-game from "Add-Ons". Manually downloaded levelpacks would be subfoldered under "Community Levels", while those already in game would be in a own folder named "Add-Ons". This would make the list of Add-Ons shorter and would clear up which levels are official and which not.

**Normal Levels**

Update with the new graphics for their assets. Also: make them more interesting! Most levels are your run-of-the-mill left to right levels and don&#39;t make use of everything available, like most enemies, vertical space, varying directions, multiple paths, autoscrolling, signs, moving tilemaps, unisolids, bricks, multiple paths, those scripting bonus blocks that can be activated by rocks, etc. Make the most of the level gimmicks!

One of the most stupid and awful level design philosophies I have seen (especially since it was used to block level proposals in the past) is to water down the quality of certain levels to make others stand out, and to this I say: No! That is stupid! You&#39;re only going to improve with time, so you can always go back and add on more and more and make ultimately all levels better. And anyway, would you rather have two amazing levels of the same quality or one crappy level + one amazing level?

Another problem with current levels is sometimes having to hit bonus blocks to advance in a level. Some official levels do this and it should be removed, because every level should be beatable without hitting a bonus block.

**Secret paths on worldmap**

Whenever a secret exit to a bonus level is unlocked, a path appears leading to that level. Currently able and might be easy to implement.

**Cutscenes**

Update cutscenes with the new story decisions and the new graphics/stuff decided for the characters.

**Boss Levels**

Update to accommodate the new fights and to make them a lot more interesting.

# Features/Mechanics

**Circular Platforms**

Platforms with circular paths, just like a flame, whose path speed can be configurable and whatnot.

**Falling Platform**

An object that shakes and falls when Tux is on it or is under it. A UNISOLID option should be added as well.

**Sideways Bouncers**

Either an option for trampolines or an entirely new object for bouncing sideways. The bounce should be stronger than Tux's jump length so it is important and should be a little longer than 32 px so it can be embedded in the side of terrain. Alternatively, it could be an object that sticks to the side of terrain. Also, it could bounce Tux to the side and a little bit up, and it should always be bouncable, even when going down/not on ground.

**Gold Pushbutton**

A pushbutton who is only activated when something is pressing it and otherwise turns off. Would have a different color and sprite to differentiate it.

**Locked Doors and Keys**

Suggested by RustyBox, key would be like a powerup and would hovering over Tux and auto-unlock any locked door. Locked doors can&#39;t be opened, etc. Would be useful for puzzle stages. Sometimes, multiple keys are needed to open a door and this should be signalled.

**Up Splasher**

A 2x2 tile wide rock-like object that acts as a less powerful trampoline. It will burst a small water fountain out of its head once Tux stands on it which shoots Tux upwards a bit.

# Object Improvements

**Rock improvements**

Make rocks bounce off of Tux rather than killing him. Rocks should not be able to kill Tux! Also, rocks should be able to activate pushbuttons.

**Dispenser improvements**

Dispensers should have an option to obey gravity.

**Skull Tile Improvements**

Skull tiles should respawn when they have fallen. Either off-screen or on-screen.

**Wind Improvements**

It should be easier to move in wind, and movement shouldn't be entirely obscured. Also wind should affect Tux while he stands, too.

# Enemy Improvements/Ideas

**Better Ghoul**

Ghouls should not collide with each other, and should not collide with solid land. Their flying speed should be configurable and there should be a blue light object which attracts them when it is turned on, shifting their focus away from Tux. Also, there should be an object that can only be broken by collision with ghouls.

**Better Haywire**

Haywire should be able to jump over a short distance (like captain snowball) while chasing Tux and not collide with/defeat all enemies in its path.

**Better Poison Ivy**

Poison Ivy should fall slower, to differentiate it from the snowball and make it more realistic.

**Rusty Bomb**

Rusty Bombs are a large variant of Mr. Bomb which are 3x3 tiles in size. They move much slower compared to other bombs but have a wider explosion radius. Furthermore, when they explode they shoot out 2-3 smaller normal sized bombs (= Hellbent).

**Hellbent**

Hellbents are black bombs that run straight towards Tux and explode on contact with either Tux, another enemy or a wall. If they face away from Tux they will turn around to run towards Tux again.

**Yeti**

Before stomping and letting stalactites fall from above, the yeti will throw 2-3 bouncy snowballs. In Pinch Mode, after his throwing attack the yeti will throw a gigantic snowball that rolls to the other side of the arena and can crush Tux against the wall if not avoided quickly. This snowball breaks when hitting a wall.

**Ghost Tree**

The ghost tree will remain idle for a short time period, its eys following Tux and only attacking from below with its roots. These can be spotted by a crack in the ground. After this, the ghost tree will scream, followed by it inhaling one set of colored ghost wisps (red > green > blue > repeat). Depending on which color has been swallowed, the tree's eys will glow in that color and it will unleash a powerful attack.

- red wisp: ghost tree rages and create a wave of roots which must be jumped over
- green wisp: summons multiple ghost forest enemies
- blue wisp: spawns an object that allows hurting the tree (maybe something like a bomb?)

While the green and blue wisps are inhaled, the roots attack will continue to accour! In Pinch Mode the ghost tree will inhale all ghost wisps and combine all their attacks continuesly. Once it looses another life all returns to normal when hit until all ghost wisps are inhaled again.

**Toucan and Totem Boss**

The toucan will primarly fly high up while performing several attacks from above. Occasionally, (if totem boss is present in the same sector) they will  land on the highest totem head to protect it from Tux - otherwise they will occasionally land on the ground, allowing for an attack by Tux.

The totem boss consists out of 5 head pieces which must all be destroyed in order to defeat the boss. Depending on how many head pieces are remaining the totem boss will perform a different attack.

- 5 heads: chases Tux and tries to squish him against a wall (requires Up Splasher or trampoline to avoid)
- 4 heads: totem shoots spikeball projectile while chasing Tux and trying to squish him
- 3 heads: spins its sharp wings while constantly jumping (instead of running)
- 2 heads: reveal spikes on top (other head spits out 1 fire rock & 1 normal rock in sequence normal rock must thrown against upper head)
- 1 head: totem flies over Tux and stombs down once it is right above Tux (like ice crusher) giving Tux time for a final attack

If a totem head is destroyed it pushes Tux away to prevent landing on the next head right away (like the 'push-explosion' radius). The throwable rock will be a mechanic in the 3rd castle or prior in world 3, allowing to break through certain walls and crush enemies (informing the player that they are throwable and effective against enemies).



# Unconfirmed Ideas

Only some, few or none of this stuff may be added, or might get added at a later time.

### Tux movement

**Controllable Fall Speed**

Tux should fall faster if he is holding down.

**Coyote Time**

Hardcoded coyote time should be implemented in the game for easier jumps.

**Walljumping**

Could be quite useful and nice to have. Would extend move set of Tux. Possible on certain tiles. To decide: Does Tux cling to the wall or slide down slower?

### Performance Improvements

**Editor Improvements**

A better text editor, Also improve infoblock UI (more like scripting UI) and BGs shouldn't shift weirdly when placed.

**Check for updates**

Upon booting up game, check for updates, and if update is available, place a "Update Game" dialogue item when the game is first opened. If the current version equals the installed version, it's plays normally. Normally only works for major releases, but in dev mode works for every nightly build.

**More particle events/effects/use of screen shaking**

We need more particle effects for different things, like for wind, to make it look better than just some small cubes, and give it actual images rather than just rects. Also, it would be nice for particles to be used more, such as when Tux/badguy lands, on wind, when slipping on ice or slime, walljumping, etc. in those events, but also in normal behavior, such as with fire/lava having particles come off/particles around it, and also there should be more particle objects, like falling leaves/blowing wind in the normal forest or sky "fairies"/glowing floaty particles in the air in the ghost forest. Also, it would be nice to shake the screen more, such as in cutscenes, when Tux is jolted, to convey certain emotions, when bombs explode, when Tux is hurt, etc. Also bubbles when Tux enters or leaves water, or makes a sudden motion/boosts/starts moving again. Many more particle events and shaking could be added to add liveliness to the game.

**More sound effects**

Add sound effects for when Tux walks on different tiles, and overall better sounds for when he dies or speaks or enters water.


### Object Improvements/Ideas

**Better background system**

Sprite files as BGs would be cool.

**Better cutscene methods**

Cutscenes should be skippable, trigger only once per level session, and text should be passed through via a button.

**Better cloud system**

Changing what/the variety of images in cloud particles, as well as speed.

**Tintable lightbulb/lantern**

A colorable, easily placeable light source for pretty effects in levels. Also, a creepy pulsing light object for the ghost forest.

**Light source objects**

Objects with sprites (cones, etc.) that specifically lit up an area or light didn't apply there, lit it up, etc. might doable using the newer graphic engine surfaces. Z-pos editable, too, and it can be rotated, and it is not solid.

**Colored Text per speaker**

In future cutscenes, Tux, Penny and Nolok might have speaking parts and there should be the ability to change color of Text in the text object per character (green for Nolok, purple for Penny, etc.) It would also be nice to have high def/large face renders of the characters to appear from the bottom of the screen when they speak.

**More editing options for decals**

Add ability to change a decal's scroll speed and tint. Also decals should be scriptable.

### Moving platform Improvements

**More velocity/acceleration driven platforms**

Allow platforms to be more velocity/acceleration driven, along with other objects that move (like Camera) and also allow the player to retain velocity that they did while on moving platforms (for events such as Tux being flung off a platform)

**Better movement on moving tilemaps**

Tux should move better on moving tilemaps. Currently he can hardly jump, or move left to right, etc.


### New moving platforms

### Enemy ideas

**Enemy Idea - Cod**

Simply a little fish enemy that swims back and forth should be added. It swims left to right, switching directions upon hitting a wall. Two variants should be added: a small and big one.

**Enemy Idea - Shadow Tux**

An enemy who copies exactly Tux's behavior and when catches up to him or collides with him Tux dies. Unkillable, but can be trapped as it only obeys Tux's moves and therefore how he collides as well. Basically a "shadow-tux" (or dark rayman-like), but would have a delay that the player can set.

**Enemy Idea - Mother Snail**

A huge sleeping snail mother that Tux cannot pass/jump over, but he can wake it up, so he has to find a way to block or move its awake form in order to progress. Possibly also produces a set amount of snail offspring, similar to a dispenser with a set value of enemies. RustyBox's snail concept but much bigger can possibly be used for this enemy.

**Enemy Idea - Bluejay**

A sneaky bluejay who sits on top of stuff and periodically throws acorns down at Tux. Acorns don't collide with tiles, but do collide with enemies and Tux. When Tux gets near it, it flies away, never to be seen again. Does a cheeky laugh/giggle after throwing the acorn, and its eyes probably follow Tux.

**Enemy Idea - Woodpecker**

The smart variant to the bluejay, the woodpecker pecks down pinecones at Tux, and sits there for a while. Tux can then use the pinecone and throw it up to defeat the woodpecker. Either the pinecone respawns after a while, or the woodpecker is smart enough to go seek out another tree with pinecones.

**Enemy Idea - Pinecone**

The pinecone for the woodpecker. Upon falling, which it only falls when pecked by woodpecker, it doesn't despawn, as it can be picked up and used as a projectile (like the rock, just with better range), but when it is falling, it can hurt Tux.

**Enemy Idea - Acorn**

The acorn that the bluejay throws. If used by itself, it falls normally, like a stalactite would, but if the bluejay throws it, it immediately begins falling no matter what. Doesn't collide with tiles, but does collide with enemies/players.

**Enemy Idea - Tentacle Monster**

A underwater enemy, which grabs Tux with his arm/tentacle and pulls him deeper into the water (or the bottom edge of the level, to be specific) to his demise. Could be used for older levels, where the swimming feature was not present.

**Enemy Idea - Blinking Ghost Roots**

These are ghost tree roots that attack based on a timer. Most similar to the tree's usage of them.

**Enemy Idea - Growing Ghost Roots**

If Tux steps on them, after he leaves them they grow up so Tux cannot walk on that terrain anymore.

# Icing-on-the-cake features

These are features that would not directly affect the core gameplay, but might be great for the game overall.

### Easter eggs (Not necessary)

**"3AM easter egg"**

If the player plays a worlds between a certain time frame, certain scripting events can happen. E.g. Levels get darker, scary, etc. easter eggs like &#39;bridge stuck&#39;

**After-a-while easter eggs/Idle-Graphics**

Snowballs and other enemies do a little break after a while. After all, they were walking for so much timeâ€¦ Tux, after a while of not moving, also gets angry and curses the screen. Jumpy just stops jumping after a while

### Other

**Ice floes**

Ice floes that respond to the gravity placed on top of them would add some goodness.

**Pigeons/Tiny Fish**

These are special background objects who, when Tux is near, flee in the direction away from his body.

**Thumbs up**

Tux should twirl and do a happy little thumbs up while the level ending is playing.
