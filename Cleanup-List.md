Since the game has been abandoned and picked up by varying people/teams over the years many core aspects, design
elements became a mish mash of ways to insure retrocompatibility. Understandable, but it is only causing more
inconsistencies and confusion as development goes on. Like a vicious circle.

With the release of **v0.7** we will freeze development on the game for a while to tackle all of the possible wrong designs
that we kept only for retrocompatibility. Fixing them will then be the main focus for **v0.7.1** after which development
will resume as normal.

The following list will contain every single flaw we could find. It is yet not complete as we are still scanning through
the game's files.

- *If you discovered any flaws yourself, we would like to encourage you to [notify us](https://www.supertux.org/contact.html).
  Thank you in advance!*
