The built-in **Level Editor** provided by the game is a great and easy way to make your own levels
and worldmaps which you can share separately or as Add-ons with the community.

There are various guides on the internet documenting how to use the level editor. We have provided
a list of several video and text based guides (as well as our own) for you to check out if you are
in need of help. You're always welcome to contribute your own, too!

**Note: Some of these may be incomplete or out-dated and it is out of our hands whether the author
will provide an update or not!**
