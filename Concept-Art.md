Concept art should go in its most specific page / section, e.g. if it a forest badguy it should go in [[Badguys Forest]] whereas if it's a new main character it should go on [[Characters]].

You should use an accordion to collapse the images so they don't clutter the page:
```
<details>
  <summary>Concept art</summary>

![](images/Image1.jpg)
</details>
```
