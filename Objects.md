Objects can be found throughout the levels in SuperTux. Some of them provide helpful items or means to progress. Others, however, serve as obstacles Tux must avoid.

### Bonus Blocks

Bonus Blocks generally contain coins and sometimes powerups. Generally you cannot see what is in the block until you hit it. They can be hit from below but also can be butt-jumped from the top as well as being hit by throwable badguys, like Mr. Iceblock.

### Info Blocks

Info Blocks can give valuable information about the level ahead. They can be hit from below or butt-jumped from on top. 

### Wooden Crates

Same as Bonus Blocks, Wooden Crates contain coins and can be hit by the same means. Unlike Bonus Blocks they commonly do
not contain anything and simply break after hitting them.

### Checkpoints

Checkpoints are represented golden bells that when rang will allow you to spawn back there if you die.

### Doors

Doors can transport Tux to another part of a level. Press the up key whilst in front of one to use it. Sometimes there will
be a door there to go back, but not always. 

### Switches

Switches can either be levers or buttons. Levers work by pressing the up key and buttons by jumping on them. They both run
scripts, which can change something in the level, like moving a platform or activate a sequence. In most cases, it will help
Tux making progress. Sometimes there will be two signs of the same colour at the switch and the thing that gets changed by
the script. 

### Platforms

Platforms take Tux to and from places. Some are always on, some move when Tux gets on them and others need to be started
by a switch or a script. They come in varying forms and sizes.

### Unstable Tiles

An Unstable Tile is an object that will fall down a few seconds immediately after standing on them. A similar object, the
Skull Tile, will only begin to fall if standing on them for too long.

### Trampolines

![](https://github.com/SuperTux/data/blob/master/images/objects/rusty-trampoline/trampoline1-0.png?raw=true "Rusty Portable Trampoline")

Trampolines are available fixed and portable and sit on the ground or on walls. They can be jumped on to help Tux reach
new heights or push him around. Portable ones can be moved with the action key. There are also ones that rust and break
after a few jumps.

### Rocks

Rocks can be carried by holding the action key. They can allow Tux to get over new obstacles by stacking them or to crush
badguys by dropping the rock on their head.

### Lanterns

![](https://github.com/SuperTux/data/blob/master/images/objects/lantern/lantern-1.png?raw=true)

Lanterns can be carried like rocks. They are also a good light source and can turn Magic Blocks of the same colour solid.
Catching a [Will-o-wisps](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/Forest-Badguys#will-o-wisp) with an empty
lantern results in the lantern glowing in the colour of the wisp.

### Magic Blocks

Magic Blocks are non solid blocks that only turn solid when illuminated by a light of the same colour.
