Main Characters
===============

Tux
---

Tux the Penguin is the main character and protagonist of SuperTux. Tux's goal in SuperTux is to rescue his
girlfriend Penny from the evil Nolok.

Tux has to chase down Nolok through different worlds with different climates, but will have different
[actions](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/Actions) to help him in his rescue attempt.

Penny
-----

Penny the Penguin is the girlfriend of Tux who has been kidnapped by the evil Nolok during a nice picnic with
her beloved Tux.

While all attempts to escape by herself have failed, she manages to provide Tux with helpful information about her
situation through secret letters. But perhaps Nolok has even taken that into account?


Nolok
-----

Nolok is the enemy of Tux, the antagonist of SuperTux. During a lovely picnic between Tux and his beloved Penny,
Nolok jumps out from behind an ice bush causing a bright flash to appear blinding Tux. He then captures Penny
leaving only a note behind.

To impede Tux's journey throughout several worlds, Nolok sends out his [minions](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/Badguys "Badguys")
as well as his most loyal [followers](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/Bosses "Bosses").

Proposed list of characters
===========================

Fluffy
------

Fluffy is a penguin that never moulted from his original fluffy feathers, so he looks like a baby penguin. He is
a good friend of Tux and Penny. However, he can't run as fast as Tux, but he can jump higher. Fluffy would be a
second character for multiplayer which the person playing the game could control instead of Tux.

Granito
-------

Granitos are rock-like creatures living in the rooted forest and plagued by the Ghost Tree corrupting their land.

Gandrus
-------

Gandrus is a big imposing walrus with a beard acting as a shopkeeper for the planned item shops.
