Icy Island
----------

### Icy Island: Intro

(Plays immediately after the game starts)

Tux and Penny are shown having a picnic at the antarctic shore. In the background, there is an ice bush, which eventually starts shaking a bit, attracting the focus of the camera. Suddenly Nolok jumps out, and the screen goes black with a flash. After fading in, Tux lies on his back, Penny is gone. Tux finds the letter Nolok left and reads it. Tux looks up, and/or walks a bit to reveal Nolok's fortress in the distance.

### Interlude: A Yeti in the Distance

(Plays after the level “The End of the Tunnel”)

Tux walks out of the ice cave but stops as he spots the yeti boss. The yeti stands higher up on a small incline and runs off after being spotted. Tux stops and thinks for a moment but continues walking forward, in the same direction as the yeti.

### Interlude: Empty Throne Room

(Plays at the end of the level "Castle Of Nolok")

Tux reaches an empty throne room with a letter hanging on a pillar. There is a door near by. Tux hears the yeti an runs towards it. He opens the door and finds himself at a balcony outside the castle walls. He jumps down into the yeti battle area.

Rooted Forest
-------------

### Rooted Forest: Intro

(Plays immediately after setting foot on world 2)

Upon setting shore, Tux hops out of his boat and takes his first steps in the grass. Tux has a small inner monolog while wandering around, looking where to go. He decides to find some place higher up to get a better view of the land.

### Interlude: The Land Is Changing

(Plays right before the corrupted forest)

Tux leaves a dark tunnel. The terrain begins to slowly change into the corrupted forest. Dark purple roots break through the ground, the sky get dark and cloudy. Tux then does spot the tower and heads off towards it.
