**Nolok's Mountain Peak** is the upcoming fourth and final world in SuperTux. The final fortress of Nolok that will require the
five world keys spelling out Nolok's name to enter. Unlike previous worlds, world 4 will be rather small but much more difficult!
Further development on this world yet to be made. Though several ideas and concepts have been collected over time.

Once development on world 3 has reached a more final state world 4 will become the development teams next prioritised task.
