Summary
-------

`DisplayEffect` is an interface for toying with the display.

Instance
--------

SuperTux creates an instance named `Effect` when starting the scripting engine. Its usage is preferred â€“ creating another instance might have unexpected side effects and is strongly discouraged. (Use `sector.Effect` in the console.) 

Methods
-------

Method | Explanation
-------|-------
`fade_out(float time)` | Gradually fades out the screen to black for the next `time` seconds. 
`fade_in(float time)` | Gradually fades in the screen from black for the next `time` seconds. 
`set_black(bool black)` | Blackens or un-blackens the screen (depending on the value of `black`). 
`is_black()` | Returns `true` if the screen has been blackened by `set_black`. Note: Calling `fade_in` or `fade_out` resets the return value to `false`. 
`sixteen_to_nine(float time)` | Sets the display ratio to 16:9, effectively adding black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. Should be used before cutscenes. Gradually fades to this state for the next `time` seconds. 
`four_to_three(float time)` | Sets the display ratio to 4:3, removing the black bars added by `sixteen_to_nine()`. Should be used after cutscenes. Gradually fades to this state for the next `time` seconds. 


Constants

None.
